I checked this with the Court of Protection who stated that only a decision made at a best interest meeting with all relevant people in attendance including a best interest decision maker was valid in law. I had supported the service user over a period of 5 months and, had visited the service user on 15 occasions in different locations and at different times to establish the service users understanding, views and wishes in regard to any move. The service user on the first 14 occasion was adamant that she did not want to move however on the 15 and last visit the service user said she wanted to move, I asked how she had got herself accommodation she said a support worker had told her. My manager was aware of my challenge and discussed the case with the C.E.O. of the Cloverleaf and another manager. The C.E.O. emailed me and said I was on the right track, the other manager after looking at my report emailed to say I had done a good job and my report contained all the relevant information, my manager also emailed and said excellent work. However, my manager received a concern (emailed on 08/03/2018) from the social workers line manager saying that I had accused the social worker of acting illegally. I new nothing of this until 28/03/2018  when I was suspended, I asked my manager why she had not spoken to me about this so as I could meet with the social workers to discuss their concerns. My manager said she only new about it the day before (which was clearly not true). I asked how could this be construed as a complaint when it was a concern. I was told I would have to leave the building pending an investigation. I was later asked to attend a disciplinary meeting where I was told I had brought the organisation into disrepute. I argued that I had followed the Advocacy Charter, the Mental Capacity Act, the Mental Capacity Code of Practice and Cloverleaf Code of Practice. It was found that I had acted appropriately and had not brought the organisation into disrepute. However I was informed that I would be dismissed as I had used the internet to job search and had photos of family on my phone. I argued that as I had been TUPED over to Cloverleaf from Rethink, that I was under Rethink terms and conditions and as such Rethink had allowed an amount of personal usage per month. I had a colleague testify that they also used the internet and had photos on their phone and that they had also searched the internet with my manager looking at clothes. I was told that I had used the internet more than others and therefore had breeched IT policy and was dismissed.","No","","No","","","I can confirm that to the best of my knowledge the above information is correct.

The care centre in Norwich housed 40+ service users over 5 separate residential houses, 2 of which had waking night staff in view of either the medical requirements or behaviour challenges. 

I started initially on a bank scheme with daytime shifts when I could more actively be involved in the supported living aspect of the role taking the service users out into the community for recreational and social activities. For the last 3.5 years I did the permanent night staff support role, involving overseeing the care of service users within my house with night and morning routines, with personal care as required. General cleaning, housekeeping duties, medication control, and maintenance of the safety and security of the premises was also involved.

During the time at Benell Care Services I encountered service users facing different difficulties, including some with complex medical needs. Different aspects of the Autistic Spectrum have been seen and as a driving instructor in previous working life I have taught a young lady with Aspberger's Syndrome to drive. I am confident in dealing with people from a wide variety of different backgrounds and abilities and can build relationships and establish trust with those I work with.

I have the ability to think and react in a thoughtful, diplomatic and tactful way, appreciating the rights and sensitivities of others, and incorporate their wishes and particular needs within the working environment. Whilst being part of the care team I do have the ability to be able to work independently to met the objectives set and look forward to resuming a career in care.","No","","No","","No","","No","","No","","","I can confirm that to the best of my knowledge the above information is correct.

I stopped practicing as a trained nurse 2017 and finally came off the register in October 2017 
I had many varied jobs, I was in the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps for 5 years, travelling to HongKong and Nepal as some of my postings.
I returned to England and worked for  a nursing agency before taking a post as night sister at a nursing home for 2 years.
I became a practice nurse after that and worked for two doctors.

Re: Executive Assistant

Dear Sir/ Madam, 

I am very interested in the role of Executive Assistant.

I believe I have the education, work experience, skills and personal attributes to be a brilliant Executive Assistant. I am degree educated – I studied Journalism at University receiving a 2.1 in addition to a Teeline shorthand qualification. I have substantial personal and executive assistant work experience and I am very positive, quick thinking, friendly and approachable.

I have worked in office roles since graduating. I spent four years as a researcher and analyst with Lincolnshire Police, where I gained skills in research, analytical techniques and performance reporting. After redundancy I then moved into PA/EA and project focussed work within the legal and public sector.

I currently work as the trusted right hand to a Programme Manager at Lincolnshire County Council for a health and social care funded project, whilst providing high level business and programme leadership. I am the first point of contact for the project office whilst attending to all administrative matters; I support in the development and writing of reports, briefings, and other forms of communication/ correspondence; I ensure accurate diary management; I serve as a liaison to the department’s senior leadership team ensuring stakeholders are kept updated; I manage the operational running of the Programme; I coordinate complex travel itineraries and prepare/ provide requisite documentation for business travel including reports and presentations; I prepare and provide documents required for meetings, including agendas, minutes, reports, dashboards and use PowerPoint when collating presentations; I attend meetings in a secretarial capacity (minute taking, actioning, risk recording). I also monitor the programme budget to ensure financial compliance across the department for audit purposes and organise large scale events across the county.

I am ready for a new challenge, which will allow me to combine and develop my education, work experience and skills further.

I hope to hear from you soon.

My eldest daughter has a severe learning disability and resides in Supported accommodation with 3 other ladies of a similar age. I have recently remarried, and my wife and I are looking to move from our current location. With this in mind I feel that I am ready to move onto further employment, I feel that I have several transferable skills.  I am keen to learn and progress within this field. 
  
I have worked for my present employer for 15 years. Initially I was employed as a support worker and worked within the housing and homeless sector.  During this time i worked with young people aged between 16 and 25 all had various issues, and some were alcohol and drug dependant. I lone worked and was responsible for 1 to 1 support with several of the young people. I feel I am able to work successfully as part of a team, but I am just as able to work alone, I am prepared to make decisions and follow these through. I feel that I always had a good working relationship with the young people who as a result were often prepared to discuss concerns that they had. I am a good listener I am not judgemental and have an empathetic approach.  
 
I have for the past 5 years managed a supported accommodation unit for adults with mild to moderate learning difficulties, some with complex needs and behavioural issues. 
This was a new venture for our organisation and I was involved with setting up the project, including staff recruitment. I was also involved in moving the project to new premises when our landlord at the time made the decision to change the use of the building. We are currently 
accommodated in 2, 6 bed bungalows, I am responsible for the day to day running of the unit including the welfare and safety of the young people. Ensuring that their needs are meet and they are supported to achieve goals that they have set for themselves. I feel that having a disability is not a barrier to a young person being able to achieve a better life for themselves and where possible they should be encouraged to lead as active a life as is possible for them. At present of the 12 young people I support 3 are in full time education (entry level college course) the remainder with support work in various retail units in the local area. A key part of support is working with the young people to ensure that they are able to achieve as high a level of life skills as possible to give them the opportunity to live as independent as is possible for them. A way that we achieve this is by use of the AQA system and life star, currently our unit is above the national average level.   I attend regular meetings with outside agencies and health officials. I have a staff team of 8 and locum support workers who fill in when staff take holiday or sickness. I am responsible for ensuring that records are maintained accurately these include support plans, life star, administering of medication as well as other paperwork/reports associated with the project. I am responsible for ensuring shifts are covered appropriately, rotas are kept up to date to include holiday cover. I am responsible for ensuring that staff meetings are held regularly, and that staff receive adequate supervision and appraisals. I am responsible for H&S within the project and reporting any incidents in relation to this. I have strived to ensure that the project is run to a standard that would compare with an Ofsted /CQC establishment. Even being a non-regulated service, all of the record keeping and the day to day running of the project is carried out within these guidelines. My aim was always to be in a position to register the project, however this was not an option, which is  I why I know feel that I want to pursue a career within the regulated sector.   
 
My time in the Royal Air force was as a Police officer. I trained as a dog handler and after only 4 years I was placed in charge of a section of 12 dogs and handlers. I was responsible for the welfare of my men and their police dogs. I later trained as a special investigator and I then spent time investigating offences on several units within the UK. I later trained as a drug dog handler and spent several years working within a drug team. During this time, I worked closely with the Civil police and Customs and excise. I was later trained in nuclear weapon security and spent time as a shift commander (SNCO) responsible for 40 men. I was then put in charge of a dog section which at the time was the largest in the Royal Air Force. I was responsible for the welfare of 26 airman and their dogs as well as their families, this included 2 Kennel maids in all my posts I have been responsible for maintaining accurate records. I have been responsible for ensuring the appropriate support has been given and the correct advice has been shared. Where possible I have encouraged and assisted in progression within the ranks. I have had to ensure annual appraisal have been completed on time and where necessary any disciplinary issues have been addressed as and when required 	 
 
I feel that I have now gained considerable experience in working with young people and especially those with Learning Disabilities and challenging behaviour. I have various transferable skills and given the opportunity I feel that I could not only gain more experience but be able to pass on to the young people my life experience and knowledge. I feel that given the opportunity I would be able to work well in the regulated field.  I enjoy being part of a team but am also able to work alone as and when required.  I am able to prioritise my work load and remain focused, I am keen and determined to succeed.","No","","No","","No","","Yes","At the time of the incident I was a SNCO in charge of 26 Airman. One evening 2 of them had been out drinking in a bar at the other side of the Airfield. They took a bicycle and road them back to their accommodation. The bicycles were reported stolen , I tried to help them return them ,rather than reporting them however as a result I was charged with the theft of bicycle, 6 months detention and discharge from The Royal Air force in 1997.
There have been no further incidents and this has always been declared at interview and has never stopped me from working with Vulnerable children or adults","No","","","I can confirm that to the best of my knowledge the above information is correct.

I have also completed over 100 computer courses with Udemy online.","No","","Advanced","Yes","Back to my car accident in 2009, I suffered a torn rotator cuff and multiple dislocations or fractures, Im as healed as I will ever be and have no ongoing problems related to this other than a knee problem in the cold weather but I have the appropriate support brace so that it doesnt cause me an mobility issues.","","Your DFW Handyman","Jeb Stuart (Client)","Owner Operator","+1 817-841-6004","","3751 N.

Having spent my years mostly freelancing and short term contracts in the entertainment and media industry i never had employers, I had clients all over the world, as a travelling musician I spent a lot of time on the road too, I have included the most recent freelance project I done as my most recent employer as he is the easiest to contact albeit in america, I built and designed his business website, I have included a link to that website in his email field should you wish to communicate with him directly through instant messenger or email... since my last full time employer at Gary Richard Homes LTD was before my accident almost 9 years ago and the business has since changed hands (privatised) in those years I have used a former workmate as my personal reference and hopefully may pass somewhat as an employment reference? as we worked in the same shift team... beyond this references may be difficult because my working patterns have been sporadic and so many people i worked with i can only have former music project partners or clients i have developed websites for online and plenty of character.","No","","No","","No","","No","","No","","","I can confirm that to the best of my knowledge the above information is correct.

and I voluntarily worked supporting parents with children with special needs. My volunteer role was advocating the families within TAC and CHILDREN IN NEED and CHILD PROTECTION CONFRENCES. I worked alongside family support workers and other agencies to help support families with routines, boundaries and understanding behaviours. I also supported families in school meeting’s, benefit appointments and the diagnosis process. I held weekly support meeting providing peer support, sign posting, and behaviour workshops in understanding behaviour. I took the lead in the running and planning of the support group. I would fund raise to support social activities for the families. 

I work as a Carer Champion with Carers First promoting the wellbeing for carers across the county with the local authorities and other agencies. This consists of collaboration with stakeholders, assemblies within schools, writing articles, and developing documentaries to better a carer’s life.

I am ambitious and always seeking out ways to improve myself. I have always been very proactive in volunteering and learning new skills while I was bringing up my family, till I was able to seek out employment. I always tackle a challenge head on to the best of my ability. Working to a high standard under pressure. Which can be seen, while I am a single mum of four children. Two with Special needs. I have pass my first year of university with a high 2.2. I can prioritise tasks with children, volunteering and university. Which shows I can work to deadlines.  I have excellent communication skills; my support work with families with complex needs and vulnerabilities has enabled me to communicate efficiently and with empathy. Because of my life experiences of being a parent carer. This has helped gain positive relationships with the families and collaborate efficiently with co-workers from other agencies. I am very confidence in public speaking, were I have gained lots of experience. I have spoken to students in lectures, schools and too commissioning services as part of my Carer Champion role supporting carers awareness. I have good awareness of my boundaries, having the confidents of knowing when to seek help. I also feel that it is good practise to reflect on my work, which has improved my abilities to work efficiently. These skills are also being improved within the skills I am learning within my degree. I am passionate about the work I do. I have worked hard to promote awareness as a carer champion and supporting families, and this can be echoed by my colleagues. I am confident in working by myself. Also working equally within a team and get on well with my colleagues. I always try to promote good working relationships to boost good working outcomes. I can also put aside any differences in my private life and people I work with, so it does not affect my work.  I am a happy bubbly person that always tries to have a positive outlook in anything I set out to achieve.","No","","No","","No","","No","","Yes","001509019898","2015-11-10","I can confirm that to the best of my knowledge the above information is correct.

I have experiance cleaning from when I worked as a barmaid for a year. After every shift, there was allways cleaning up to do, from sweeping, hoovering, cleaning toilets and the bar.

After being out of work for so long, and my second son getting ready to start school , I am very eager to get back into work. I am very reliable, a great team player, but, I also have the intentive to work well alone. 

I belive I will work well within your team to deliver a high standard of cleaning.","No","","No","","No","","No","","No","","","I can confirm that to the best of my knowledge the above information is correct.
